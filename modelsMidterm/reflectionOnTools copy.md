Prolog is a logic programming language
Prolog allows users describe relations between variables using Horn clauses (called rules and facts).
A rule has a head that introduces variable and a body that contains predicates on these variables.
A fact is a predicate on concrete values.
A user can run a query in the form of a rule or a fact about variables.
The Prolog engine will try to find values that satisfy the body predicates.

- intelligent agents in simulated environments
- knowledge base query engine

Z3 is an SMT solver.
Given a symbolic formula in a certain theorem, Z3 can try to find such values of symbolic variables in that formula such that the formula is valid.
Z3 supports bolleans, numbers, strings.

- Optimization problems
- identification of theorems
- constraint solver in proof assistants
- LiquidHaskell - static correctness checking for Haskell programs

Isabelle
interactive and automatic theorem prover.

Allows to write mathematical proofs in a human-readable declarative language.
Supports multiple formal methods and encodings of logics.

- Formal verification of programs
- computer-aided formalization of mathematical texts
- generation of Haskell, Ocaml, etc. code from proofs
